# Start coding your solution by creating a `run_guessing_game` method. Once
# created, the method should be responsible for the following:
#
# - Generate and store a random number between 1 and 6
# - Prompts the user to guess their own number between 1 and 6
# - Capture user input from the command line
# - Compare that input to the random number that has been generated
# - Print out one of three statements:
#   - If the user's input matches the random number: `You guessed the correct number!`
#   - If the user's input DOES NOT matches the random number: `Sorry! The computer guessed <number>.`
#   - It the user's input is equal to "exit": `Goodbye!`
#
# Run `learn` to see your progress and `learn submit` when you've solved the lab.
